UiWorker
========

Helper class for simple changing UI elements. If this object is created in UI thread the job will be
executed immediately, if not the job will be executed on the UI thread delayed.

##Setup (gradle based)

Edit your `build.gradle` and add this line to your dependencies:

    compile 'eu.rekisoft.android:uiworker:1.0.1'

So it should look like this:

    dependencies {
        // other dependencies comes here
        compile 'eu.rekisoft.android:uiworker:1.0.1'
    }

##Example
A sample implementation will follow soon.
